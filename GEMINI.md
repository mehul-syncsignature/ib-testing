    - `GET /api/designs`: Fetches all designs for the authenticated user.
  - **`generate-text/`**: AI-powered text generation.
    - `POST /api/generate-text`: Generates asset variants based on user prompts.
    - `GET /api/generate-text`: Retrieves generated content for a user.
  - **`remove-background/`**: Image background removal.
    - `POST /api/remove-background`: Removes the background from an uploaded image.
  - **`upload/`**: Handles file uploads to S3.
    - `POST /api/upload`: Generates a pre-signed URL for file uploads.

- **`app/dashboard/`**: The main dashboard view for logged-in users, containing the `AssetBentoContainer`.
- **`app/editor/[type]/`**: The core design editor. The `[type]` is a dynamic parameter for the type of template being edited (e.g., `social-post`). This page is composed of the `Canvas`, `ControlPanel`, and `StylePanel` modules.
- **`app/onboarding/`**: The user onboarding flow after signing up.

### ðŸ“‚ `components/` - Reusable React Components

- **`components/ui/`**: Base UI elements (Button, Input, Card, etc.) from `shadcn/ui`.
- **`components/instant-branding/`**: Contains the actual React components for the different design templates. These are the visual templates users can edit.
  - **`featured-post/`**: A component for creating featured posts with a title, description, CTA, and main image.
  - **`quote-card/`**: A component for displaying a quote with an author's name, title, and image.
- **`components/AITextGeneratorDialog/`**: A modal component for interacting with the AI text generation feature.
- **`components/AssetBento/`**: A grid component for displaying and managing user assets (logos, images). It uses a unified configuration to render different asset types and handles user interactions for selecting and editing assets.
- **`components/DraggerWithCrop/`**: A sophisticated image upload component that includes drag-and-drop, cropping, and background removal functionalities. It also handles S3 uploads.
- **`components/SideBar/`**: The main navigation sidebar for the application. It includes user authentication status, user menu, and navigation links.

### ðŸ“‚ `modules/` - Feature Modules
These directories group components and logic for a major feature area, often composing smaller components from `components/`.

- **`modules/Canvas/`**: Manages the main design canvas in the editor. It dynamically renders the selected component based on the `type` parameter and applies the current brand and style context.
- **`modules/ControlPanel/`**: The panel in the editor that contains controls for manipulating elements on the canvas. It uses a dynamic form based on the selected asset type and allows users to edit text fields, toggle brand marks, and adjust image properties.
- **`modules/StylePanel/`**: The panel in the editor for managing styles, colors, and fonts. It displays a list of available styles for the current asset type and allows users to switch between them. It also includes the export functionality.

### ðŸ“‚ `lib/` - Core Libraries & External Services

- **`lib/api.ts`**: Client-side helper functions for making requests to the backend API routes.
- **`lib/serverApi.ts`**: Server-side API helpers.

- **`hooks/brand.ts`, `designs.ts`, `user.ts`**: Data-fetching and state management hooks for their respective resources.

### ðŸ“‚ `contexts/` - Global State Management

- **`contexts/AppContext/`**: Provides global application state, including loading states, user information, and authentication status.
- **`contexts/BrandContext/`**: Holds the current user's brand information, such as colors, fonts, and logos, making it accessible to all components.
- **`contexts/AssetContext/`**: Manages the state of the user's uploaded assets, including the current asset type, style, and data configuration.

### ðŸ“‚ `providers/` - React Context Providers

- **`providers/PaddleProvider.tsx`**: Initializes and provides the Paddle SDK for handling payments.
